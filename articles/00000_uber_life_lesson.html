I think Taxis, Lyft, Uber, etc. drivers are some of the most interesting people you will ever meet, seriously, you should talk with them if you don&rsquo;t already do.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The following is just one example of the life lessons that can be learned when you simply talk with people you maybe haven&#39;t considered doing so with before.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I was in San Francisco last week for Dreamforce, a yearly conference my company puts on to bring the community together in one place to talk about the future of Salesforce. After having dinner and drinks with my colleague Thursday night, I hailed an UberX to return to where I was staying for the week. In a little more than a minute, Kiri (name changed) was picking me up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Since I was young, I have focused on living and gathering as many experiences as possible to grow my consciousness of people and the World. To that end, the first thing I almost always ask an Uber driver is how long they have been doing it, how they became an Uber driver, if they like it, and why or why not. These simple questions usually lead to a great conversation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>This is Kiri&#39;s story.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>When he was 7, he was living in Cambodia, during the time of the Khmer Rouge. He told me how the regime discriminately started to separate the rich, educated, advanced members of the country from the poor, working class. Once they did so, they proceeded to destroy all people they associated with opulence, seized their assets, then instituted forced labor for the remaining uneducated and poor working class. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>For Kiri, this meant at the mere age of 7, he and his 4 year old sister were taken from his family to go work in a labor camp. He told me about his daily routine of waking up early, walking through jungles filled with poisonous snakes, using the scent of a local plant as a deterrent to keep them at bay while they worked. After the long day, and a pittance for a food allowance, he and his sister would hug and huddle together closely in the dark nights on the dirt ground to stay safe.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Kiri continued to live this way, the daily life of pure will power just to survive at the tender age of 7, with a sister of only 4 years. Miraculously, he was able to persevere through those torturous years of the Khmer Rouge and 23 years ago flew into San Francisco at SFO airport. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>He didn&#39;t need to go far. Upon landing at SFO, he told his mother he was going to get a job at SFO, save money, and buy her a house. One thing I would learn of Kiri is that if he says he is going to do something, you can consider it as good as done. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>It took him the greater part of 20 years, but Kiri kept his unbelievable promise to his mother and indeed did get her a house. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Our conversation covered this and many other things, including communism, ISIS, Russia/Georgia/Ukraine/Caucasus, the Chinese economy, and World politics in general.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>By this time we had arrived at where I was staying, far outside the city, given that as a remote Salesforce employee, we stay outside the city to ensure as many rooms as possible for our guests attending the conference.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Kiri knew I had a 06:30 flight and that Uber would be hard to get where I was at 04:30 in morning. Without me even asking, he said he would wake up at 04:00 and drive to where I was to ensure there would be at least one Uber available to give me a ride to the airport. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I am not exaggerating when he texted me at 04:00 saying he was on his way, arriving at exactly 04:30, much to my pleasure, as there was definitely no other Uber drivers anywhere in the vicinity. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>On the ride to the airport, Kiri filled me in more on his work at SFO, in fact, he still works there full time, but took vacation, so he could work extra driving Uber during the hectic activity of Dreamforce. </span><span>It should be noted that while I am sure in this particular case, Kiri enjoyed talking with me, and that it was an experience we both otherwise would not have had, the fact the conversation happened under these circumstances should still be questioned. Here we have a an example of someone who is genuinely great and fought hard to get this far, continues to work hard, but even with all that has to take vacation to work another job. We can&rsquo;t just have a choice, we need genuine choices to choose from, more on this later.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As someone who considers themselves in general to be cut from the humble, hard-working fabric of Iowa, I can&#39;t even begin to describe the amount of respect I have for someone that lived through genocide, struggled at a low paying job their whole life to better the lives of their family, and was now helping make my day easier, just so I could catch my morning flight to be back with my wife and home before the Friday work day started.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Before saying goodbye to Kiri, for which I hope won&#39;t be the last time, I asked him ultimately how he views America compared to his life in Cambodia. Without even flinching he summed it up with, &quot;In Cambodia, I did not have the choice of what work I did, it was chosen for me. Here, I can choose my work, or to not work at all, and that is what freedom means to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the end, the freedom to say no is a powerful thing, even if you only decide to use it sparingly. Without that choice, you are no longer a human. Further, when you deny that choice to someone, you are no longer a leader, you are an oppressor.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I think most people forget how relatively young our country is, and that we truly are an experiment in what it means to be a country for the people. Given our democracy is an experiment, we should be willing to take observations and refine the experiment over time. The only block to our progress is the mental block in people&rsquo;s minds of what is possible. Sometimes all you need is the belief something is possible, then be inspired with the will and means to do it. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Imagine a country where everyone has a base salary, health care, and a home. In essence, imagine a country where everyone&#39;s basic needs are met, so that they literally could live an adequate life without working a day in their lives.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The question is, if people&rsquo;s basic needs are met, and they are truly given the choice to do whatever work they want, whether it be an artist, an Uber driver, or someone like me who enjoys automating things with technology, what will they do?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>It is my firm belief that happy, healthy people are the core to innovation and progress. When good people have their basic needs met, they will go out of their way to improve the society they now genuinely feel a part of. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you sat down, and calculated all the numbers, you would see we easily spend and waste more money debating and auditing how we take care of people vs actually taking care of them. We have the ability to do so, we only have to want to, and be empowered to do it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Once you have something like a basic living salary for everyone, things like automation suddenly become a moot point. Who cares if McDonalds and Uber automates things? They should! Why have people doing laborious, error-prone labor, when a program can do it better? The only argument that holds any weight is the loss of jobs, jobs that really aren&#39;t needed anymore with the advance of technology, and that wouldn&#39;t be required if we thought more than just a few days into the future at a time. We can get there, it just requires consciousness, honesty, and the genuine will to continue America on it&#39;s founding principle of freedom, this time, truly for everyone.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>For Kiri, once he had a universal basic income and health care, maybe he loves driving and talking to people so much, he would still choose to do it, without any other reason than the enjoyment he gets from helping get people where they need to. But if not, maybe he wants to play guitar or have more time to enjoy his passion, swimming, ensuring he lives a long, healthy, fruitful life. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>A lot of people like to mock hard work and determination, with the ever known reframe, &quot;good guys finish last.&quot; After today, I feel more and more the reality we want is, &quot;good people should finish when they want to.&quot; This presumes of course they live in a place where they are empowered to do so. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p></body></html>
